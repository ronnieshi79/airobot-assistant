## 📖 Introduction

**AiRobot Assistant** is a highly customizable robot client system that seamlessly integrates with leading Agent platforms (such as Xiaozhi AI, Coze, Dify, etc.). Designed specifically for Android tablets and desktop robots with screens, this project enables developers to build custom applications for scenarios like learning companionship, office assistance, eldercare, and more.

Different from traditional voice assistants, this project leverages cutting-edge LLMs and centers around **"dynamic emotional interaction"** and **"proactive scenario services"**. With vibrant and delicate animated IP character behaviors, lightning-fast full-duplex voice interactions, and dynamic on-demand extension cards, it brings warm, immersive "digital life" companion experiences to users. AiRobot breaks the limitation of one-way Q&A and elevates the interaction to proactive service delivery, aligning closer to users' real needs.

### 🎯 Core Positioning

- **🤖 Multi-Engine Agent Base**: Decoupled design that supports flexible attachment of diverse Agent platforms (e.g. Xiaozhi AI, Coze, Dify), allowing access to top-tier models and ecosystems.
- **🎭 Immersive Digital Life**: Presented via delicate and expressive 3D/2D animation IP characters, breathing life into AI and providing a true sense of physical companionship beyond mere text or static voice.
- **🗣️ Full-Voice Interaction**: Full-duplex and full-voice mechanisms featuring instant wake-up, streaming recording, real-time voice recognition, and bidirectional interruption.
- **🧩 Dynamic Card Services**: A pioneering proactive service card loop. In conversations, the AI not only replies via voice but also actively pushes service cards (e.g. Tomato Timer, weather reminders, AI memos) to users.

## ✨ Core Features

### 🎭 Animation Interaction
- **Multi-Role IP Representation**: Supports seamless switching between 3D/2D animated characters, with highly customizable character visual styles and interactive behaviors.
- **Dynamic Emotional Expressions**: Characters feature smooth transitions across states (listening, thinking, speaking, idling), naturally aligning with semantic emotional cues to avoid robotic interfaces.
- **Enhanced Visual Feedback**: Offers rich visual micro-interactions for states such as network exceptions, wake-word listening, processing, etc., ensuring system feedback is easily perceived.

### 🗣️ Full Voice Interaction
- **Fast Offline Wake-up**: Integrates efficient Keyword Spotting (KWS) to immediately respond to wake-words and transition to active dialogue.
- **Intelligent VAD**: Uses highly accurate Voice Activity Detection (VAD) for automatic phrase segmentation and silence detection.
- **Voice Interruption**: Supports real-time interruption while the robot is speaking, enabling natural, flowy turn-taking.
- **Continuous Conversation**: Supports continuous multi-round dialogue after waking up, eliminating the need to repeat the wake-word for every query.
- **Noise Suppression & Echo Cancellation**: Integrates hardware-assisted AEC and gain-control optimizations to ensure accurate voice recognition in far-field or noisy environments.

### 🧩 On-demand Function Card Services
- **Automatic Service Delivery**: Once the Agent recognizes the user's intent, it can push interface cards via the custom protocol, achieving a "what you talk is what you get" experience.
- **All-Scenario Business Templates**: Built-in and extensible card modules, currently including Focus Tomato Timer, AI Memo, Task Alarm, Podcast DIY, Audio Podcast, Video Podcast, and more.
- **Infinite Extensibility**: Powered by a protocol layer mimicking MCP, developers can quickly add various utility or lifestyle modules to the robot's brain.

## 🔖 How to Use

Mainly consists of the following steps (current system supports Xiaozhi AI Agent):

1. **Step 1: System Device Activation**
   After installing the app, navigate to "System Settings" -> "System Authentication" and click to activate the device. **Note: Currently the system only supports Xiaozhi AI Agent** (support for Coze/JoyAgent, Dify, etc., is planned in subsequent releases).

2. **Step 2: Xiaozhi Backend Agent Binding**
   Retrieve the "Device AI Agent Activation Code" (e.g. `642225`) displayed on the screen. Go to the Xiaozhi AI Console and add this activation code to your configured Agent settings to bind the device.

3. **Step 3: Wake Up and Converse**
   Directly wake up the robot using the wake-word (e.g. "Xiao Ye, Xiao Ye") to start chatting.

4. **Step 4: Smart Podcast Experience (Creation & Playback)**
   - **Podcast Creation (DIY Card)**: Issue a voice request like "I want to create a podcast about AI technology", and the AI will push a "Podcast DIY Card". Customize the topic, hosts' genders, and style on the card, and click to submit.
   - **Podcast Playback (Audio Playback)**: Once generated, the system launches the "Podcast Player Card", playing your custom podcast via our high-performance media subsystem. The character's animation will adjust dynamically to the audio.

> **💡 Note**: For details about Xiaozhi AI Agent configurations, please refer to the official Xiaozhi AI manuals.
